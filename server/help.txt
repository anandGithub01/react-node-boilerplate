# Folder Structure
1) We are managing module based folder structure.
2) `/modules` will have all module folders. Every module will have `**.controller.js`, `**.routes.js`, `**.service.js`, `**.validation.js`.
3) All models will be inside `/models` folder.

# Routing Pattern
1) All open end points will have `/api` prefix.
2) We are combining all module routes in `/routes.js`.
3) All module routes will be in their module folder.
4) For smile and clear import url we are using `module-alias` module.

# Validation
1) All field(name, password , email, etc) validation rules are written in `/validations/validation-field-rules.js`. 
2) `validationHandler` HOF takes these rules and call each one by one, These are actually middleware, If error then return from that point and if success move to controller. 
3) We are using `express-validation` for data/field validation (https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)

# Sanitization


# Database
1) We are using sequelize(https://sequelize.org/) ORM for database interaction
